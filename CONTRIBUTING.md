## Making a Pull Request

* The pull request should have a useful title, like `Add [name of apprenticeship]` instead of `Update README`.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.

### Formatting

```markdown
* [Company/Apprenticeship Name](link) | City/Cities | Description of company/apprenticeship
```

* The link should not be to a direct link to the application page.
* Use [title-casing](https://capitalizemytitle.com/).
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* Suggestions (apprenticeship or further resource) should be sorted **alphabetically**.
  * Most text editors have a built in sort function that makes this super easy.
* Suggestions should be categorized by the right country and also sorted alphabetically with the United States showing first.
  * e.g. United States, England, Portugal, etc.
